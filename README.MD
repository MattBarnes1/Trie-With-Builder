This trie was written for a game I was working on with a group of people. The builder pattern I used for the trie (passed via constructor) allowed for the control of what kind of enumerator, trie node, and terminal node could be used. Originally, the goal was to provide a customizable trie with behaviours abstracted away from the Trie class. For example, I could build a trie where every non-terminal node would be a condtional in a quest that a given set of quests shared. The custom enumerator would iterate through these non-terminal nodes and if it reached a terminal node, the quests contained would be activated. The hope would be that I could avoid iterating through all the conditional nodes of the quests. The worst case performance would be only marginally greater than that of a list, but if quests had conditionals that overlapped, it would provide a speed up over a normal list. The test I originally used is included.
